## 🔍 SAFE CROSS-PROJECT WORKFLOW

### Example: Copying a feature from gangrunprinting

```typescript
// STEP 1: Read from gangrunprinting (ALLOWED)
Read(/root/websites/gangrunprinting/src/lib/payments/square.ts)

// STEP 2: Adapt for current project (ALLOWED)
// Copy relevant code, update imports, adjust to local structure

// STEP 3: Write to stores-stepperslife (ALLOWED)
Write(/root/websites/stores-stepperslife/src/lib/payments/square.ts)

// STEP 4: Commit to stores-stepperslife (ALLOWED)
git add src/lib/payments/square.ts
git commit -m "Add Square payment integration (adapted from gangrunprinting)"
```

---

## 🎓 VALIDATION BEFORE OPERATIONS

### Before ANY WRITE operation:
```typescript
function validateWritePath(path: string): boolean {
  const PROJECT_ROOT = "/root/websites/stores-stepperslife";

  if (!path.startsWith(PROJECT_ROOT)) {
    throw new Error(`
      ❌ WRITE BLOCKED: Path outside project boundary
      Attempted: ${path}
      Allowed: ${PROJECT_ROOT}

      You can READ from other projects, but WRITE only to stores-stepperslife.
    `);
  }

  return true;
}
```

### Before ANY READ operation:
```typescript
function validateReadPath(path: string): boolean {
  const WEBSITES_ROOT = "/root/websites/";

  // Allow reading from any project
  if (path.startsWith(WEBSITES_ROOT)) {
    return true;
  }

  // Warn about reading outside websites directory
  console.warn(`Reading outside /root/websites/: ${path}`);
  return true;
}
```

| Delete file | ✅ | ❌ | ONLY current |
| Git commit | ✅ | ❌ | ONLY current |
| DB query | ✅ | ❌ | ONLY current |

## 🔍 SERENA MCP PROJECT ACTIVATION

```
✅ CORRECT: Serena, activate project: /root/websites/stores-stepperslife
❌ WRONG: Activating any other project
```

---

## ✅ SELF-CHECK QUESTIONS

Before ANY WRITE operation:
- ✅ Am I writing to /root/websites/stores-stepperslife?
- ✅ Am I using the stepperslife_store database?
- ✅ Am I committing to the stores-stepperslife repo?

Before ANY READ operation:
- ✅ Am I reading for reference/learning purposes?
- ✅ Will I adapt copied code to stores-stepperslife?

If ANY write operation fails these checks → STOP and REFUSE.

---

## 💡 REMEMBER

**READ from ANYWHERE, WRITE to CURRENT PROJECT ONLY**

To modify another project:
1. Exit current session
2. cd to target project
3. Run `claude-safe`
